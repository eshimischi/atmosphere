## Installation

To install Loger, you'll need to clone or download this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/jesusantguerrero/atmosphere.git project_name
```

Next, we can install Atmosphere with these **4 simple steps**:

### 1. Create a New Database

During the installation we need to use a MySQL database. You will need to create a new database and save the credentials for the next step.

### 2. Copy the `.env.example` file

We need to specify our Environment variables for our application. You will see a file named `.env.example`, you will need to duplicate that file and rename it to `.env`.

Then, open up the `.env` file and update your *DB_DATABASE*, *DB_USERNAME*, and *DB_PASSWORD* in the appropriate fields. You will also want to update the *APP_URL* to the URL of your application.

```bash
APP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=loger
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

### 3. Add Composer Dependencies
```php
composer install --ignore-platform-reqs
```
### 4. Run Migrations and Seeds

```bash
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
php artisan journal:set-accounts
```
<br>

backend development
```bash
php artisan serve
```
Frontend development
The bachend have to be running

```bash
# install npm packages
npm install
# development
npm run dev
```

ðŸŽ‰ And that's it! You will now be able to visit your URL and see your Atmosphere application up and running.
